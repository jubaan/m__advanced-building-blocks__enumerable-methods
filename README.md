# Project 2: Enumerable Methods

> The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.

This project was very challenging for my. I read a lot to come up with this solution, this is what worked for me, but I was also found at least 5 other ways to solve this exercise.
